## Getting Started

### Environment Setup

To ensure compatibility and stability, it is recommended to use a `conda` virtual environment for dependency isolation.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/luanshiyinyang/FacialExpressionRecognition.git
cd FacialExpressionRecognition
conda create -n FER python=3.6 -y
conda activate FER
conda install cudatoolkit=10.1
conda install cudnn=7.6.5 -y
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

For Linux users, a one-click setup script (`env.sh`) is provided. Execute the script as follows:

```
bash env.sh

```

- ## Data Preparation

  Datasets and pre-trained models can be downloaded via [Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1LFu52XTMBdsTSQjMIPYWnw) (password: 2pmd). After downloading:

  - Move `model.zip` to the `models` folder in the root directory and extract it to obtain the `*.h5` model file.
  - Move `data.zip` to the `dataset` folder in the root directory and extract it to access the dataset files. (**It is recommended to use the pre-processed JAFFE dataset included.**)

## Network Design

The system employs a classical Convolutional Neural Network architecture, drawing inspiration from leading research papers presented at CVPR 2018 and Google's "Going Deeper" design. A (1,1) convolutional layer is introduced after the input layer to enhance non-linear representation while keeping the model efficient. The architecture maintains a shallow design with most parameters concentrated in the fully connected layers, striking a balance between performance and computational cost.

## Model Training

The system has been trained on FER2013, JAFFE, and CK+ datasets. Since JAFFE contains half-body images, face detection was performed as a preprocessing step. Results include:

- **FER2013**: Achieves 67% accuracy on the public and private test sets, despite challenges such as noisy labels and low-quality images in the dataset.
- **JAFFE and CK+**: Achieves over 99% accuracy in 5-fold cross-validation, reflecting strong performance on high-quality, well-labeled datasets.

Training can be initiated using the following command, specifying the dataset (e.g., `fer2013`, `jaffe`, or `ck+`), batch size, and number of epochs. Training logs and performance visualizations will be automatically generated.

```
python src/train.py --dataset fer2013 --epochs 300 --batch_size 32

```

## Model Applications

### **Web-Based Interface**

The system offers a **web-based facial expression recognition application** that is both intuitive and accessible. Users can upload static images through the online interface, allowing the system to automatically detect all faces, classify their expressions, and display results in real time. The processed image, with labeled expressions, is displayed directly in the browser and can be downloaded for further use.

#### Key Features:

1. **Face Detection**: Automatically detects multiple faces in an uploaded image.
2. **Expression Prediction**: Recognizes and classifies facial expressions for all detected faces.
3. **Real-Time Visualization**: Displays the processed image with labeled results directly in the browser.

#### How to Use:

1. Open the web application in your browser (e.g., `http://localhost:5000` for local deployments).
2. Upload an image using the provided upload button.
3. The system processes the image and overlays predictions on the detected faces.
4. View the results directly on the webpage and optionally download the processed image.

#### Example Workflow:

1. **Image Upload**: Drag and drop or select an image file from your device.

2. **Processing**: The server processes the image and runs facial expression recognition.

3. **Results Display**: The processed image with labeled expressions is displayed on the webpage.
